# YOLOv5 Drowsiness Detection

## Overview

This repository contains a custom-trained YOLOv5 model designed for real-time drowsiness detection. The model was fine-tuned using manually labeled images in YOLO format, emphasizing scenarios related to drowsiness.

## Training Details

- **Architecture:** YOLOv5
- **Workers:** 3 for parallel processing
- **Epochs:** 1000

## Real-Time Alarm System

Upon successful deployment, the model is integrated into a real-time alarm system. When signs of drowsiness are detected, the system triggers an alarm, providing an immediate alert to mitigate potential safety hazards.
